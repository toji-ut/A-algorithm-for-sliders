# 15 Slider Puzzle Solver

## Overview

The **15 puzzle** is a classic puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. The puzzle consists of a 4-by-4 grid with 15 square tiles labeled from 1 through 15 and one blank square. The objective is to rearrange the tiles into numerical order by sliding them into the blank space, using as few moves as possible.


**Goal State:**

```
    1  2  3
 4  5  6  7
 8  9 10 11
12 13 14 15
```

```
   A  B  C
D  E  F  G
H  I  J  K
L  M  N  O
```

## Project Goal

In this project, I implement the **A* search algorithm** to solve the 15 puzzle. The A* algorithm is a popular search algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points.

### How to Run

- The A* algorithm implementation and necessary functions are included in the codebase. Simply run the program to see the puzzle solver in action.
  
- The program prints the puzzle configurations and uses the A* search to find the optimal solution.
